**Put a file called API.txt in the same directory as the parser, start the parser and if the file is correct, it should create a vscode snippets file**

[Example of how this file should look like](https://github.com/Aviarita/OnetapAPI-Parser/blob/master/API.txt)

[Precompiled binary](https://github.com/Aviarita/OnetapAPI-Parser/releases)

[Parsed snippets](https://github.com/Aviarita/OnetapAPI-Parser/blob/master/javascript.json)


The created javascript.json file goes into 
C:\Users\\\<user\>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets
